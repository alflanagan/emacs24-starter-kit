#+TITLE: Batch File to Install ert-runner Package
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil ^:nil

This program installs the "ert-runner" package in the elpa
subdirectory, so that we can use it to run tests without loading
everything and the kitchen sink.

* Installation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :tangle:   yes
  :comments: noweb
  :noweb:    yes
  :END:

** Load a bunch of crap so it's tangled

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load-file "./init.el")
#+end_src

We need some setup for package module to get things in the right
place.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq starter-kit-dir user-emacs-directory)

  (setq package-user-dir (concat starter-kit-dir "elpa"))
#+end_src

** Implementation

Do the actual work in `after-init-hook` so that everything is
(hopefully) set up correctly.
#+name: install-ert-runner
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook
            (lambda ()
              (princ (concat "package-user-dir is " package-user-dir ".\n"))
              (package-initialize)
              (unless (package-installed-p 'ert-runner)
                (princ "Trying to install ert-runner.\n")
                (package-install 'ert-runner))))

#+end_src
