#+TITLE: Batch File to Execute ERT Tests
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:nil ^:nil
To begin with, we need to load everything, since emacs won't run
"init.el" automatically in batch mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (load-file "./init.el")
#+end_src

All the startup code was added to `after-init-hook`, which also won't
trigger automatically.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (run-hooks 'after-init-hook)
#+end_src

Now we're set up. Load all the test files from test/, and execute
tests.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (mapc (lambda (dir)
          (org-babel-load-file (concat "test/" dir)))
        (directory-files "test" nil ".+test.org"))

  (ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit)
#+end_src
