** Basic Tests for Emacs Starter Kit

*** Test Run Global Setup
Because we're running in batch mode, we have to explicitly load
"init.el" and run the functions on `after-init-hook`.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; coding: utf-8; -*-

  (require 'ert)
  ;; (load-file "init.el")

  ;; (princ "init.el loaded.\n")
  ;; (run-hooks 'after-init-hook)

#+end_src

*** Tests
**** Verify installed packages

Verify first that all the startup .org files got tangled and loaded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun verify-installed-package-p (pname)
    "If PNAME is not a  loaded feature, attempt to `require' it. Return PNAME if `require' fails."
    (or (featurep pname)
       (require pname (symbol-name pname) t)))

  (ert-deftest verify-installed-packages ()
    (princ (format "lloyds-installed-packages has %d members.\n" (length lloyds-installed-packages)))
    (princ (format "features has %d members.\n" (length features)))
    (and (mapcar #'verify-installed-package-p
               lloyds-installed-packages))
    )
#+end_src

**** Basic tests
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (ert-deftest basic-tests ()
    "Currently just a placeholder"
    (should t))
#+end_src
