** Basic Tests for Emacs Starter Kit

*** Test Run Global Setup
Because we're running in batch mode, we have to explicitly load
"init.el" and run the functions on `after-init-hook`.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t; coding: utf-8; -*-

  (require 'ert)
  (load-file "init.el")

  (princ "init.el loaded.\n")
  (run-hooks 'after-init-hook)

#+end_src

*** Tests
**** Verify installed packages

Verify first that all the startup .org files got tangled and loaded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (ert-deftest verify-installed-packages ()
    (princ (format "lloyds-installed-packages has %d members.\n" (length lloyds-installed-packages)))
    (mapc (lambda (x) (should (member x features)))
          lloyds-installed-packages))
#+end_src

**** Basic tests
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (ert-deftest basic-tests ()
    "Currently just a placeholder"
    (should t))
#+end_src
